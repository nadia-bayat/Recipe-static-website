      <span>Ingredients:</span> 3 cups bread flour, 2 & 1/4 tsp instant yeast, 2
      tbsp white sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 cup hot milk, 1 large egg, 2 tbsp
      vegetable oil
      <br />
      <br />
      <span> Instructions:</span> In a large bowl, whisk 2 & a half cups of
      flour, yeast, sugar and salt (Do not add salt directly to the yeast). Add
      milk and beat well using an electric mixer or your hand. Add the egg and
      oil and stir in the remaining flour and mix well to form the dough. When
      the dough is formed, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead
      until smooth and elastic. Cover it with a cloth and let it rest for 10
      min. Roll it out to get a rectangle(with the same length as your loaf
      pan's). Form into a loaf and place it in a loaf pan. Cover the loaf with a
      cloth and let rise in a warm place for 60 min. Preheat the oven to 190Â°C
      for 15 min. Bake for 15 minutes. Take the bread out and cover the top with
      foil and bake for 15 more minutes. Fall in love with its taste and smell!
